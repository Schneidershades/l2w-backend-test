## Software requirement

The following software need to be install on your system: 
1. Composer
2. And access to the terminal (script is guaranteed to run in a linux-like environment - MacOSX and Ubuntu). You may need to find out how to run this on windows if you encounter any troubles. 

## Packages/Software in use
3. [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
4. PHP
5. Node Packages (NPM)


### Running Laravel Artisan Command

After installing the required software stack, to fireup the system run the following commands.

To run any artisan command, you use a [`php artisan`] command and pass in the usual parameters.

The format of your command will take the following format. 

` app php artisan --insert rest of command here --`

At some point, the above command can be placed into a proper run script. 

### Laravel .env file update
The project still makes use of the laravel .evn file. 
However, we need to update the a few variables.


## TODO
- [ ] Add support for exporting log files and error messages.
- [ ] Add bash script to run most used commands
